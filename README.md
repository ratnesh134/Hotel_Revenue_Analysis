## Metrics and Calculations

* **Revenue:** Total revenue generated from room sales.
* **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room):** Calculated as `Total Room Revenue / Total Available Rooms`.
* **DSRN (Data Source Revenue Number):** [Provide a clear definition of this metric. For example: "Number of reservations from a specific data source"].
* **Occupancy:** Percentage of available rooms occupied, calculated as `(Total Occupied Rooms / Total Available Rooms) * 100`.
* **ADR (Average Daily Rate):** Average price charged per occupied room, calculated as `Total Room Revenue / Total Occupied Rooms`.
* **Realisation:** Percentage of the listed price achieved, calculated as `(Average Price Achieved / Listed Price) * 100`.
* **DURN:** [Provide a clear definition of this metric].

## Visualizations

* **Trends by Key Matrix:**  A line chart displaying trends in RevPAR and ADR over time (likely by day of the week).
* **Revenue % by Category:** A pie chart showing the proportion of revenue generated by different categories (e.g., Business, Luxury).
* **Realisation % and ADR by booking platform:** A combined chart (likely a bar chart for Realisation % and a line chart for ADR) showing these metrics across different booking platforms.
* **Property Performance Table:** A table providing a detailed breakdown of key metrics for individual properties, including Revenue, RevPAR, Occupancy, ADR, DSRN, DURN, Realisation, Cancellation %, and Average Rating.
